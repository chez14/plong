# Colors

Plong extends [default colors from
Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) with chez14's
personal branding. This includes the Wandering White, Restless Red, and Gloomy
Gray.

Here's the corresponding Pantone Color ID: 

- Worrying White: [PANTONE 427 C](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/427-C)
(`#D0D3D4`) 

- Restless Red: [PANTONE 1788 C](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/1788-C)
(`#EE2737`) 

- Gloomy Gray: [PANTONE 433 C](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/433-C)
(`#1D252D`)

Those colors then get extended to fit [Tailwind's color
convention](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors). "Pure" color will
be assigned to `600` and then spread with SASS's `lighten`/`darken` function to
fit the rest of color palletes.
